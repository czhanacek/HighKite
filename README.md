This is the final project for CptS 122 - Advanced Data Structures at Washington State University

Git SOS:

Here's the workflow that seems to work well:

  git fetch // This gets the latest code from what's current on github

  git checkout <<your unique branch (and not your master)>>

  git add <<files you want to add>>

  git commit -m "<<Your informative commit message>>"

  .... keep committing until you've got something to deliver .... then...

  git checkout master 


  git rebase <<your unique branch from above>> // when you run this, you should see a message about fast-forwarding master. This command keeps your local master branch up to date with your most recent code.

  git checkout <<your unique branch from above>>

  git push origin <<your unique branch from above>>
